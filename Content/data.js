Yokai expanded from demons into a wide range of creatures and, in Japan today, they are pop-culture sensations. Yokai popularity grew over the centuries as they materialized in different cultural forms including visual arts, stage performance, storytelling, and games. Yokai are now such smash hits that some Japanese cities and prefectures have reshaped traditional images of demons and demon-like deities for festivals and tourist attractions.

                            body: `<p>Yokai images burst onto the popular scene thanks to woodblock print technology in the Edo period (1603–1867).  Now, copies of a print could be created quickly and cheaply. Whereas the early scroll paintings had limited audiences, prints were accessible and affordable. As specific depictions of yokai began to circulate among the masses, the images became popular cultural references.</p>

                            <p>Toriyama Sekien’s series of books of “The Illustrated Night Parade of a Hundred Demons” (<i>Gazu hyakki yagyo</i>) is based on the <i>Hyakki yagyo</i> scrolls. This series of books is considered the first mass-produced and illustrated yokai encyclopedia, with yokai ranging from the very popular to the lesser known, and includes some dreamed up by Sekien himself. Sekien standardized yokai images. His drawings of specific creatures served as an important visual resource for later artists, including Edo period printmakers, twentieth-century manga creators, and yokai artists today. </p>

The Earth Spider, Tsuchigumo, appears in the background and dispatches yokai to attack the heroes. This three-part print is known for its social commentary, critiquing oppressive governmental codes enacted as the Tenpo Reforms (1841–1843). When Kuniyoshi published this work, viewers understood the yokai as a metaphor to be those suffering due to the reforms. The image suggests the government’s nightmare of a popular uprising. Another layer of social commentary concerns the Earth Spider. Traditionally viewed as a legendary outcast and a source of evil, t Kuniyoshi depicted the Earth Spider as a hero who leads the angry mob of monsters in seeking revenge against the shogun and his administrators. This print is one of many works that show how yokai may be used as symbols of marginalized people.`

Stage theater was particularly popular during the Edo period (1603–1867) and numerous classical plays featured ghost, demon, and monster-like characters. These characters and their stories have enjoyed long-lasting appeal. Ghostly stage presentations from centuries ago inform today’s iconic image of vengeful female ghosts, with long disheveled hair, a white death kimono, and no feet. A number of contemporary Japanese horror films feature these images and they have also made their way into Hollywood blockbusters, such as like <i>The Ring</i> (2002).</p><p>Among the forms of traditional Japanese stage performance that portray demons and ghosts are puppetry, noh, and kabuki theater.</p>`,

                                <p>The play <i>Hidakagawa iriaizakura</i>, centers on the lovelorn Kiyohime and a monk named Anchin.  Set at Dojoji Temple in Wakayama in the year 929, the play details the destructive nature of obsessive passion. Kiyohime falls in love with Anchin but he rejects her. Kiyohime’s rage, damaged pride, and emotional pain overtake her and she loses complete control of herself and her humanity. She transforms into a serpent-demon, swims across a river, and makes her way to Dojoji Temple, where Anchin hides from her under a large bronze bell. She finds him, coils herself around the bell, spitting flames until Anchin burns to ashes.</p><p>Awa ningyo joruri is a regional style of puppet theater specific to Tokushima, where performances take place on an open‑air, village stage. It takes three puppeteers to operate one puppet: one each for the head, hands, and feet. Puppetry is one of Japan’s oldest performance genres and some forms are inscribed on UNESCO’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage</p>`,

                            <p>Kabuki theatrical performance developed in the Edo period (1603–1867), a time of relative prosperity with new markets for leisure activities. People of all social classes were drawn to the theater to see the newest plays. Kabuki was especially popular for its stage tricks, special effects, and action. Ghost stories were very popular and often challenged social norms, especially those related to gender roles and economic status. Kabuki is inscribed on UNESCO’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage.</p><p><i>Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan</i> (“Ghost Story of Yotsuya Road”) was written by Tsuruya Nanboku in 1825 and is one of Japan’s most famous ghost stories. The story centers on a woman, Oiwa, whose husband, Iemon, decides he wants to marry a wealthier woman. He poisons his wife’s cosmetics, which horribly disfigures her face. He then tries to set her up to look like she was having an affair with a man named Kohei so he could divorce her. She eventually dies in a dramatic, self-inflicted accident and Kohei is killed. Iemon nailed their corpses to opposite sides of a door and throws it in a river. Oiwa’s strong emotions transform into an uncontrollable, terrifying rage and she comes back as a vengeful ghost, haunting Iemon for the rest of his life. This theater print demonstrates stage effects created by the playwriter. In Act III of the kabuki play, Iemon finds the door floating down the river. When he hoists it out of the water, Oiwa’s corpse comes to life as a ghost and haunts him; when Iemon flips the door over, Kohei’s corpse does the same. The effect inspired this “trick” print, using a flap to allow the viewer to flip back and forth between the two ghosts. A flap on the middle panel of this triptych opens to reveal Iemon holding Oiwa’s corpse nailed to a door; when the flap is closed we see Kohei.p>`,

                            <p>This popular festival involves up to twenty-two, eighteen-foot-high, 650 to 1500 pound ushioni (cow demon) floats, each associated with different local shrines. They are carried by fifty shrine members to the center of town, where the ushioni dance and battle with one another as they parade towards Warei Jjinja (Uwajima’s main Shinto shrine). Each festival day centers on different activities including a youth-float parade (involving smaller ushioni floats), music and dance, bamboo pole-climbing competitions, and fireworks.</p>
                            <p>The floats are highly interactive. Attached to a long neck that extends from the float’s enormous body, the ushioni head swings across crowds of people creating delight among tens of thousands of spectators. The festival’s roots are in Warei Jinja’s four hundred-year-old rituals where smaller-scale ushioni are purified by shrine priests to dispel negative spirits and bring blessings to the community. In 1965, the city of Uwajima developed the Ushioni Matsuri as a public festival to increase tourism and boost the local economy. More than that, the festival brings local communities together to compete, to collaborate, and to celebrate; it is a source of community enjoyment, identity, and pride.</p>`,

Once admitted, they chase family members, roar, and call out children for laziness or misbehavior. Children provide offerings of food and sake to the Namahage, who then talk with family members, explaining their role as gods descended from the mountains to bless people with good fortune.</p> 
                            <p>This ritual is distinct, but related to the festival <a class='color-red font-weight-bolder' href='https://www.namahage-oga.akita.jp/english/index.html' target='_blank'><i>Namahage Sedo Matsuri [<i></a>, created in 1963 to share Namahage with outsiders. As opposed to the private New Year’s ritual within the household, the public three-day festival occurs on the grounds of the Shinzan Jinja (a local Shinto shrine) in mid-February. It is a large event that involves dancing, roaring demons that chase audiences around icy grounds, bonfires, food, sake, and taiko drumming. Fear is at the heart of the Namahage experience, and the Namahage are at the heart of regional identity and pride. In 2018, Namahage was added to UNESCO’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage.</p>`,

                    body:`<p>In Japan today, debates exist as to what exactly is a “yokai.” They are generally considered to be a catchall term for beings like ghosts, demons, and a wide variety of monsters as well as “mysterious phenomena.”</p>  
                    <p>Some people prefer words such as <i>bakemono</i> (changing things), <i>obake</i> (spooky things), and <i>mononoke</i> (weird, mysterious occurrences) to describe specific categories of beings. People began using the word “yokai” during the Meiji period (1868–1912) when scholars began studying Japanese folklore.</p>
                    <p>Despite ambiguities, scholars generally agree that yokai include <em><b>tanuki</b></em> (raccoon-dogs), <em><b>kitsune</b></em> (foxes), <em><b>tsukumogami</b></em> (haunted tools or objects), <em><b>kappa</b></em> (water yokai), <em><b>tengu</b></em> (mountain spirits or goblins), and <em><b>oni</b></em> (demons).</p> 
                    <p><em><b>Yurei</b></em> (ghosts) are included in this museum exhibition as a kind of a yokai, but not everyone agrees. Yurei are spirits of deceased humans with intense emotions and lingering ties or resentments in this world, whereas yokai were never human, are very much alive, and can be playful (yurei are not playful!). Looking at representations of yokai in popular media and art from the last five centuries, we find all sorts of beings: tormented ghosts, ogres, demons, monsters, shapeshifters, and personified animals. They all seem to categorically belong. Do you agree?</p>
					<p>Explore these categories of yokai in the collection of the Museum of International Folk Art. </p>

They may be annoying but are rarely evil or dangerous. Tanuki figures are found all over Japan, often welcoming patrons to shops and especially restaurants and bars. Holding a bottle of sake, tanuki like to get people drunk so they lose track of time and can be tricked out of their money. Although they may be creatures to approach with caution, for businesses and shop-owners their image is used as a charm for bringing prosperity. Tanuki are notorious  for their larger-than-life testicles, which they may sometimes use as a prop for their disguises and pranking activities.</p>`,

In ancient times, yokai were limited in their physical forms to <i>oni</i> (demons) and religious contexts. The Muromachi period (1336–1573) introduced new sorts of beings with a famous narrative scroll painting called the “Tsukumogami ki (The Record of Tool Specters).” According to the story, if tools and other implements are discarded without a proper show of thanks, they become resentful of their former owners and haunt them with a vengeance. The scroll likely served the purpose of spreading Shingon Buddhism, but sarcasm and wit narrate the illustrations.</p><p>Tsukumogami are something to be feared, but they definitely have a comical and entertaining side. Additionally, these spirited objects freed oni from its depiction as a menacing demon, allowing a nearly limitless array of forms. By the Edo period (1603–1867) all sorts of “things” could come to life and transform into yokai.</p>`,

Folklore suggests that kappa are relatively harmless creatures, but they can indeed be very dangerous. For example, kappa infamously drown people to eat their livers, accessed by sucking out an imaginary organ called the <i>shirikodama</i> found in the anus. Luckily, kappa are appeased with cucumbers, their favorite food. A dish-like depression on their heads contains water, the source of their power. If they spill the water not only can they lose power, but they can die.</p>`,

A <i>karasu tengu</i> is a bird or bird-like tengu. They are usually associated with flight, and sometimes their form is a combination of a long-nosed man with bird wings. Tengu are generally considered malevolent spirits. In early Japanese Buddhism the image of the tengu as a monk was sometimes used to convince people not to follow opposing Buddhist groups. However, like other yokai, tengu do not easily fall into a good or bad category. Despite their description as malicious, tengu can also be noble and helpful.</p>`,

At these events, people told regional ghost stories they knew or they invented new ghost stories. Traditionally, the storytelling began with lighting one hundred candles and at the end of each story, a candle was extinguished. When the last flame went out and darkness descended, yokai were said to appear.</p>`,

                    body:`<p><i>Obake yashiki</i> (“monster houses”) are considered a traditional form of Japanese amusement. They are particularly popular in the summertime because, as people often say, spine-chilling experiences cool you down! The late-summer festival Obon is a time when people honor their ancestors, perhaps another explanation for the Japanese association between summer and spirits. Obake yashiki may date back to the Edo period (1603–1867), as an amusing way for warriors to prove their bravery during a time of relative peace. Japanese-style haunted houses gained popularity after World War II and draw upon folklore and traditional imagery to create a scary walk-through experience in a maze-like setting. Similar to American haunted house traditions, obake yashiki are often found in amusement parks. Although the point is to frighten people, it is meant to be a fun experience. After all, sometimes it is fun to be scared.</p><p>The Museum of International Folk Art and yokai scholar and artist Kono Junya, who is also a lecturer at Saga University of the Arts in Kyoto, collaborated on a monster house for the yokai exhibition.</p>Kono Junya spent two and a half weeks at the Museum of International Folk Art to handcraft the monsters that populate the house, all based on traditional Japanese folklore and art. Hyakuyobako artists participated as actors, writers, and collaborators on the ghost story videos.

                    botbody:`<p>Vivid in Japanese art and imagination are creatures that are at once ghastly and humorous. The Japanese word <i>yokai</i> generally refers to a range of supernatural beings such as ghosts, demons, monsters, shapeshifters, tricksters, and other strange kinds of creatures. While their status is commonly described as supernatural, they intermingle with and appear in the natural, human world. Today, yokai are wildly popular in Japan—prevalent across contemporary entertainment genres such as manga (“comics”) and anime (“animation”) series, horror movies, and video games, and they also manifest as the subject of related material culture objects like game cards, character t-shirts, cuddly plushies, and collectable gashapon capsule toys. This diverse array of yokai imagery and materiality is deeply rooted in the past. Yokai images and their stories are enduring, and there is no question that what we see in hot commodities today is closely aligned with the traditional Japanese folklore. This book explores yokai through multiple perspectives: what they are, their associated tales, how people engage with or interpret them in different contexts, and why they remain so popular in Japan. The contributors to this book are eminent scholars, creators, and promoters of various aspects of yokai culture. The interdisciplinary nature of this book’s presentation vibrantly illustrates yokai from different angles, allowing for a broad view of their cultural scope in Japan. In addition, the contributors delve into popular culture themes, connecting traditional folklore, folk art, and imagery to trends in Japan as well as in the United States.</p><p>Contents:<br>
